## Overview of the School District Analysis

### Explanation of the Purpose

The purpose for this analysis was to correct the flawed data concerning the ninth grade students at Thomas High School all the while ensuring the rest of the data is whole for the other grades and schools in PyCity District. We completed and in depth overview of the key metrics for each school which we presented in table format. The metrics of the School Districts we analyzed were, top 5 performing schools, the bottom 5 performing schools, the average math & reading score for each grade, scores by school spending per student, scores my school size and scores by school type. We are able to draw conculsions on the performance of each students reading and math scores based on the variety of influencing measures. 

## Results of Analysis

Using the same data set from module 4 we were able to analyze the results and draw conclusions by comparing the data frames after replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores. The district summary was barely affected as this is a large data set we are drawing our analytics from and Thomas High School and the perentage of students in ninth grade is only a fraction of the total data. 

The table below features the orignal analysis of the PyCity School Districts schools & students including the average math and reading scores.
